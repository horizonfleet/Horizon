# Horizon

This repository contains a prototypical implementation of a fleet management system. The system uses an advanced truck fleet simulation, spark structured-streaming and machine learning to predict the delay of trucks, as well as a powerful frontend to display the current position and information about all trucks in a fleet, arranged in a Lambda architecture. It is intended to be hosted inside a kubernetes cluster.

The software was developed during summer semester 2020 as part of the course "Data Science Project" at Stuttgart Media University under the direction of Professor Dr. Jan Kirenz.

The team consists of Anja Stütz, David Rundel, Felix Bieswanger, Jan Anders and Sebastian Hermann.
